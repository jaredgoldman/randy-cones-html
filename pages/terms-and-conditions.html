      <h2>OWNERSHIP AND COMMERCIAL USE</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        You Own the NFT. Each NFT created by Randy Al is an ASA on the Algorand
        blockchain. When you purchase a NFT, you own the underlying asset, the
        Art, completely. Ownership of the NFT is mediated by the Algorand
        blockchain: at no point may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the
        ownership of any Randy Al asset. Once you transfer an NFT to a wallet
        not belonging to you, you also transfer the right to use the Art, tied
        to the NFT, to the owner of that wallet. This means you no longer hold
        the license for PERSONAL USE or COMMERCIAL USE.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>ii. PERSONAL USE.</h2>
      <br />

        Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Randy Al grants
        you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the
        purchased Art, along with any extensions that you choose to create or
        use, solely for the following purposes:
      </p>
      <ol class="list">

        <li>
          as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your
          Randy Al asset, provided that the marketplace cryptographically
          verifies each Randy Al asset owner’s rights to display the Art; or
        </li>
        <li>
          (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the
          inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Randy Al asset,
          provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each
          Randy Al asset owner’s rights to display the Art for their Randy Al
          asset to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art.
        </li>

        you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the
        purchased Art for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon
        the purchased Randy Al asset (“Commercial Use”). Examples of such
        Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the Art to produce and sell
        merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the Art. This
        could extend to but is not limited to
